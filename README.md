Jsyncdb synchronizes json compatible javascript objects
This will be a monorepo for jsyncdb clients and servers

to get the doccker for this:
docker pull jfinn9c/jsyncdb

I will update this with developer instructions in mid-late summer (I'm on a different project right now)

if you do want this in the meantime message me (I'll improve code's readability soon)

files that are needed to run the javascript client:
 
jquery-3.5.1.min.js
jsync_lib.js
jsync_demo.js (you only need the function jsyncdb_init_helper and can point it at a different backend)
